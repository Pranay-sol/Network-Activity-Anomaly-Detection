Week 5 Assignment from the Summer Analytics, 2024.

A hackathon organised by Ai planet (DPhi).
Network Activity Anomaly Detection, by Consulting and Analytics Club, IIT Guwahati
Build a model to predict whether a network a network is experiencing "normal" activity or "neptune" activity

PLACED 3RD.

The assignment consisited of training a model on exisiting training data and passing prediction for the test data.

The Data was firstly, processed in an orderly and sophisticated fashion, 
by removing or replacing Nan Values, removing irrelvant data columns, converting categorical data into numerical and then standardising all the converted data into a simpler number base.

This was then followed by dividing the train data into train and test split for validation and parameter tunings.

Cross Validated different models and algorithms to find the most optimum pairing of model and its parameters to attain the highest score.

The model choosen for the task was an Essemblem Gradient Boosting Model.

The predictions were converted into an .csv file for submission.

The model scored 99.9878.
